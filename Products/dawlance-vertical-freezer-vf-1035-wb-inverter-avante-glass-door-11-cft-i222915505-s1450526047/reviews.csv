I was concerned that how can I return if refrigerator is damaged or not working. But its working\nAlthough i cannot confirm that it is inverter technology or not because on packaging it is mentioned that it glass door freezer so still in doubt.\nI was astonished to see that the freezer actual price is 17499.69 and sold me of 56000. I am charged more than 300% profit. See the pictures.\nOr it is too old model and sent me in new packing \nJust pasting a sticker or packing don't make freezer as of inverter technology, see the compressors section, it don't show any signs that it is inverter technology. Still in doubt\nGlass door is beautiful and not broken.\n1 more questions,  the temperature knob can not moved back to 2 or less than 2 so can't change it to work as FRIDGE.\nIt is not defrost item so a lot of snow in every part of freezer.\nAt the end, its working fine up till now."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Neelo A.","comment":"its really sirprize..in 48 hours i recved ..abi start nahi kia. .but i hope .thek hi hu ga.thnk u so much"},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by 3***7","comment":"Today I Ve received this Dawlance product product is safe and no mishandling."}]
