[{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Hassan S.","comment":"I have ordered this Refrigerator and adding this review after a couple of weeks, it's doing great and working absolutely fine. delivery was very quick and came the next day of the order, packed well, and arrived safely. The only complaint I have is, that there is no protective grill behind the fridge where the compressor and all the wires are located. fortunately, we don't have mice in our house otherwise it would really concern me. The warranty card I received has a March date stamped on it while I ordered and received it in June so it's disappointing. rest everything is good working perfectly fine and great refrigerator indeed. \n\nUpdate: I have received the call from customer care and they have noted my suggestion about the grill and said they will forward it to the concerned, and manufacturer didn't include grill in this model but the wires and stuff are protected by a protective sheath. About the warranty, they also mention that I can claim the warranty from the date of invoice."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Sarosh J.","comment":"Excellent Product from Dawlance definitely recommended to others"},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Masood S.","comment":"Very nicely packed.
