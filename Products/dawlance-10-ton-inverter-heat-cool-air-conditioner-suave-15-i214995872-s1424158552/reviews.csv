Now one day later I see that Dawlance is selling it at 66500. Feel cheated"},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by 3***4","comment":"overall I am happy with the product quality, packaging, and product performance but as u can see in the picture it is stated in the specs. that its blue fin under home feature heading .. but its not .. its actually gold fin. Further even after chatting with the seller no one could explain me the difference between model Suave15 and Powercon15 despite having a price difference, the mentioned specs. are all same, which is actually a surprise for me. I would still rate them 5 star, because this is not their fault but the company should look in to it that what they are publishing and against which model."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Muhammad A.","comment":"Very satisfied with seller. got original product. but outdoor back grill is missing.\noverall good product"},{"rating_score":1,"person_name":"by Fahad A.","comment":"!!!Pathetic!!!\n\nIt has been more than a week now that I bought this Inverter AC SUAVE 15 but still waiting for their services team to visit my home and install it. Unlike other companies, Dawlance is not offering FREE INSTALLATION and even with a charge of Rs.3000 I have been waiting for a week now.\n\nEvery day, I get confirmation that our team is on the way and the day just ends like that. I registered 2 complaints on helpline and everyone is giving me new number every time. Upon calling the technician number I received via TEXT msg today, he gave me number of the guy who is on his way to my home since Friday.\n\nWORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!....BETTER KEEP YOUR RELIABILITY WITH YOU, DAWLANCE TEAM"}]
