[{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Umar A.","comment":"I'm satisfied with the product and it is a nice purchase. had some scratches in the fridge and on edge of the inside glass door. pic not attached. \nThis is the official Dawlance Pakistan store.\n2 Buttons behind to control the cold and hot water. (should introduce light switch)\nThe Water taps, hot and cold water taps work great. If you don't use the warm/cold water tape too much then the warm water tap will be a little bit chill.\nThey are magnetic in both doors to close them. Rubber around the fridge.\nThe Fridge temp around 12-18C and normally i see 15-17C (in November while hardly using the water tap n opening the fridge door)\nThis Water Dispenser isn't for those who want chilled drinks, ice cream, etc, and don't want to buy a room fridge.  It will be normal cold after a few hours but not chilled. Maybe the same for other dispensers.\nThe compressor doesn't run regularly if the water is not depleted much. Good feature to save electricity and its life."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by MUHAMMAD U.","comment":"Very good product and build quality. Highly recommended.
