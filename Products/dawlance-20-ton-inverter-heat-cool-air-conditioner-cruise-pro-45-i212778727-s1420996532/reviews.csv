The product was as described (as expected of a Company Like Dawlance). Fully satisfied with my purchase.\nCalled the Dawlance Customer Centre for Installation and they installed it (although its not free-of-charge). \nGreat Service and purchase experience, alot better as compared to open-markets.\n\n2 Month Ownership Update: \n\nThis AC has Substandard Air filters, \nThat let too much Dust pass through the Blower wheel and Evaporator coil gets chocked in less than a month. That will then cause airflow and cooling issues with bad smell. \nI approached Dawlance regarding the issue and they simply had the unit serviced, it worked again but the root cause (sub standard Air filterss ) was never solved."},{"rating_score":3,"person_name":"by 0***7","comment":"Product is same as shown in the picture, jo outdoor unit hy wh thora damage hy, ski net phatti hue hy,"},{"rating_score":1,"person_name":"by Mansoor T.","comment":"AC supplied was produced 3 yrs ago.
