[{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Ayesha K.","comment":"One, I am very grateful that Dawlance have made an automatic multicooker (instant pot) available at a price which is beyond competitive: at the company price of PKR 25k, it is only one-quarter of the price of other brands. Buying from Daraz.pk gave me a further discount of 3500/- which is a splendid deal.\nThe associate company which makes this multicooker is Turkish (arçelik). This brings me to point Two which is that the Dawlance online intro video for this product is not very helpful in guiding one in how to actually cook in it. Even the accompanying recipe book has muddled instructions in places (likely because it has been translated from Turkish into English by a non-Pakistani) so the muddled grammar can be confusing. The only cooking videos available for guidance are those made by Turkish users.\nThird,  essentially it can be used as an electric pressure cooker, but the 'Fry' function is used with the lid removed to fry masala before adding curry ingredients."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Waqs A.","comment":"Received it few days ago it's amazing for cooking anything you want with Good Heat and low voltage consuming of just 1100 watts.\n\nThe build quality and safety is also really good.\n\nIt's worth buying from sale, the price of this is 25000 but i got it for 21500 rupees + delivery included which was 400.\n\n10/10 experience packaging was also very nice and tidy."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Zoheb A.","comment":"Dawlance DWMC 3015 multi cooker is a great appliance. Not only is it perfect for cooking comfort foods during the winter months, but it can be save your time & money all year end. \n\nThey're versatile, combine a range of function into one appliance, & save valuable cupboard space by replaceming multiple appliances. My sister is using already this nice product."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Reema K.","comment":"The packaging was excellent. I've first time tried cooking in an instant pot and I have to say multicooker was quite easy to use. I made macaroni and it turned out great. Overall cooking time was 10 mins. If you are a newbie in cooking or someone who is like me who wants the food to get cooked instantly then you should choose  this product. The product comes with a warranty card, a manual, and a Recipe book. I feel they should also include urdu language in their recipe book so that a lot of women can take advantage of it. Once you purchase the product you also receive an invoice from daraz."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Imran H.","comment":"Thank you very much i am happy & satisfied with this product."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Zohaib A.","comment":"Awesome product.

Double cardboard box. Brand new . No damages. It’s working.\n.\nFor DAWLANCE:: only 3 stars for the product because; \nthe user manual is badly written. Not easy to understand. Is not explained in detail, lots of small things need explanation but not found in the user manual. So naturally the learning curve is steep..\nJust because of that it seems not easy to use. If operating it was explained better .. it may have been easier, but as of now it’s like keep experimenting and try and learn and discover. "},{"rating_score":3,"person_name":"by Asim G.","comment":"The Recipe Book and User Manual is useless. It says press the saute button but I am unable to find the saute button. All the instructions in recipe book did not make sense. I also tried to download recipe book from site but none is available. No videos on YouTube on how to cook. Poor execution / launch of product from Dawlance.
