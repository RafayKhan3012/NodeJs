Air through is also very good on turbo mode. maximum speed is also fine. Package came earlier than expected and with good packing. Faced only two problems. It was not inverting even after 2 hours of continuous use on turbo mode. than i called support guy who came next day. he changed the position of indoor and outdoor sensors and after that now inverting in just half hour. and running on 1.5 to 2.3 amp range after inverting (depending on weather). and even sometimes works on .9 amp in after 3 4 hours. which is v v good.

Being an engineer myself, I know that many rooms sized around 120 sqft in Pakistan requires only 0.75 ton AC. Now, there is an option and hopefully a good one in the long run.\nInverter air conditioners work best in Karachi if temperature is set at 27C or higher. I set it at 28C which is comfortable given the high ambient and the AC was sipping just 1.5A! This roughly translates to one unit of electricity in 3 hours. About Rs. 6 an hour. For an 8 hour daily usage I expect the bill to be about rs. 1500.\n\nThe AC is decent looking. Plastic is a bit flimsy on closer inspection but this is a non issue.\n\nI just pray it survives at least three seasons. Like all local air conditioners, I am afraid it will be the indoor which would develop leakage in the long run. Fingers crossed.
