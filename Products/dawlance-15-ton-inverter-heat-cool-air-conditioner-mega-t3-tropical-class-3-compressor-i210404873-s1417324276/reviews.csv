[{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Habib A.","comment":"This review is being written after over a week of use of this AC. This the first time I ordered something this expensive online & I had my heart in my mouth as I was making this purchase blind. Thankfully the AC over all was in good condition. The outer was flawless & the fins were perfect on the condenser. The inner unit had some of its fins bent but not as bad as I had seen in one review. Still, I had to put in three hours to fix the fins, going over each one with a tweezer.\nWarranty card & all the accessories were present. The delivery was very fast & secure as it came through TCS. The box was undamaged which was superb. The Dawlance team was quick to respond on chat and were quite courteous & helpful.\nThe AC's cooling & throw are fantastic, MaShaaAllah. AC on 25Â°C after attaining the temp. runs between 2.5Amps-3.1Amps which is superb Alhumdolillah.\nI am 100% satisfied with the AC. I hope when I order next, my AC units will have perfect fins.\nThank you Dawlance, TCS & Daraz."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by Syed M.","comment":"Very good product with immediate delivery.\nReceived within one Day."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by A***.","comment":"Got the perfect deal for the inverter, less price than the market.\nOne thing to mention, Warranty card was missing in the package, called Dawlance Helpline, they very professionally and politely took the responsibility and provided me a new warranty card within 24 Hrs.\nNow for the inverter, it's cooling is very good, after reaching the desired temperature set, it stabilizes itself around 2.5 to 2.7 amp. Which is just equal to my room cooler from Super Asia.\nMy overall experience is great with Daraz, Dawlance after sale support and Inverter Itself"},{"rating_score":1,"person_name":"by Mateen","comment":"I received this Ac today, I was very happy about it, but happiness turned into disappointment when I opened it. Its indoor unit upper Finns were damaged (pictures attached), and more disheartening was its outdoor unit condenser coil was completely cut (pictures attached) that means this AC is of no use, that doesn't mean it damaged during shipping, its box was fine from that side, they deliberately packed malfunctioned product. I WANT MY COMPLETE REFUND. I have initiated the return of this product."},{"rating_score":5,"person_name":"by 3***9","comment":"Product delivered on time,cooling is perfect,Packing was good to opeserve the product.
